// else (absent, stale, tampered) means "auto" — hand control back to the OS.
// The single source of truth for what counts as a valid override, shared by the
// toggle. (The inline pre-paint guard in index.html duplicates this check by
// hand because it must run before any module can load.)

// preference, so one step of a three-way cycle is always colour-neutral.
// Visiting the theme that matches the OS last puts that neutral step on the
// wrap back to auto, so every other click visibly flips the colour (no dead
// first click). The cycle order is therefore derived from the OS preference.

// "auto" both keep their prefers-color-scheme queries so the OS drives the tint;
// a forced light/dark makes the matching meta apply to all media and the other
// to none. Extracted from theme-toggle.js's setScheme so the all/"not all"
// mapping — easy to invert — is unit-tested. See test/theme.test.js.
