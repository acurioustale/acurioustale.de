# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

The personal landing page for [acurioustale.de](https://acurioustale.de): a single
static `index.html` styled as a terminal "whoami" card, with one stylesheet and
two small ES modules in `js/`. No framework and no build step; the deployed site
ships no dependencies (the only npm packages are dev-time linters plus the jsdom
and Playwright test harnesses, see below). The
`js/` modules are plain ES modules served as-is and loaded with `type="module"` —
no bundling.

## Commands

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000   # serve locally, then visit http://localhost:8000
npm run lint                  # lint JS, JSON, CSS and Markdown (ESLint, stylelint, markdownlint-cli2)
npm run format                # Prettier write across the repo (format:check verifies; used by CI)
npm test                      # run unit tests (node --test)
npm run coverage              # unit tests + coverage thresholds (the gate CI enforces)
npm run test:e2e              # run browser smoke tests (Playwright, chromium; separate from CI gate)
npm run links                 # check links locally (lychee, separate from CI gate)
./validate.sh                 # run the FULL gate locally: shell, format, lint, tests, xml, csp, og-image, svg
./validate.sh --clean         # run with a clean install (npm ci) first, matching CI exactly
./deploy.sh                   # deploy to production by hand (uses your own SSH access)
./deploy.sh --dry-run         # preview what the deploy would change
```

There is no build step for the site — edit the files and reload the browser. CI
validates the HTML, CSS and SVG (Nu Html Checker), checks XML well-formedness of
`sitemap.xml` (xmllint), checks formatting (Prettier), keeps the SVGs optimised
(svgo), lints the shell scripts (ShellCheck and shfmt), the workflows
(actionlint), the JS, JSON and inline HTML scripts (ESLint with `@eslint/json`
and `eslint-plugin-html`), the CSS (stylelint) and the Markdown
(markdownlint-cli2), runs the unit tests under a coverage gate (`node --test
--experimental-test-coverage`, via `npm run coverage`) and the CSP and og-image
guards (`tools/check-csp.mjs`, `tools/check-og-image.mjs`) on
every push and pull request, and deploys are gated on all of them passing. Run
the same checks locally with `./validate.sh` (needs `brew install vnu
shellcheck shfmt actionlint` plus `npm install` for the npm-only tools: Prettier,
ESLint, stylelint, markdownlint-cli2 and svgo; xmllint ships with macOS/Xcode but
can also be installed via `brew install libxml2`). `validate.sh` skips any brew
CLI that isn't installed (with a notice — CI still enforces it) so it runs on a
fresh checkout; Node and npm are the only hard requirements. Link checking and
the browser smoke tests are separate and non-gating — the `links` workflow runs
lychee on pull requests and a weekly schedule, and the `e2e` workflow runs the
Playwright specs (a browser download) on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
Deploys gate only on `validate`, not on either of these. The dev dependencies
that need `package.json` are ESLint (plus `@eslint/js`, `@eslint/json`,
`eslint-plugin-html` and `globals`), stylelint (plus `stylelint-config-standard`),
markdownlint-cli2, Prettier, svgo, jsdom (the DOM harness the wiring tests run
against) and `@playwright/test` (the browser smoke tests). The CI guards and the
pure-logic unit tests use only Node's standard library; only the DOM-wiring tests
(`test/terminalDom.test.js`, `test/themeToggleDom.test.js`, via
`test/helpers/dom.js`) need jsdom, only the `e2e/` specs need Playwright, and the
site itself still ships no dependencies. Prettier uses its defaults; keep the Prettier, shfmt, actionlint
and Node versions pinned in `.tool-versions` in sync with the project — `validate.sh`
asserts the shfmt and actionlint versions when present (hard errors on mismatch;
Node is a warning), while Prettier's version is enforced via the npm lockfile.
`.claude/launch.json` defines a
"site" launch config that serves on port 4174.

Two transitive dev dependencies of `markdownlint-cli2` carried advisories and are
pinned to patched versions through `overrides` in `package.json`: `markdown-it`
(`^14.2.0`) and `js-yaml` (`^4.3.0`). The js-yaml pin deliberately stays on the
4.x line: the fix for its quadratic-complexity DoS in merge-key handling was
backported to 4.2.0, while the 5.x line drops the default export
`markdownlint-cli2` imports and so would break it. Both are dev-only tooling that
lints our own files, so there is no untrusted input regardless, and `npm audit`
is clean.

## Theme system (the one piece of real logic)

Light/dark theming is split across the stylesheet, the inline `<head>` guard and
the `js/theme-toggle.js` module, and is easy to break if you touch only one. The
model is three-way — **auto** (follow OS), **light** and **dark** — and the
toggle cycles through all three. Because **auto** always looks like the OS
preference, one step of any three-way cycle can't change the colour; the cycle
order is derived from the OS preference so that unavoidable no-op lands on the
return to **auto**, and every other click visibly flips light/dark (no dead first
click on a light-mode OS). That cycle order is the pure function `nextTheme()` in
`js/theme.js`, unit-tested in `test/theme.test.js` — change the order there, not
by editing the toggle inline.

- `css/style.css` sets `color-scheme: light dark` on `:root` and defines each
  colour **once** as `--token: light-dark(<light>, <dark>)`. The browser
  resolves each `light-dark()` to its light or dark value from the used
  `color-scheme`, so the OS preference drives the colours for free (this is what
  makes the no-JS path follow the OS). The explicit toggle does not re-map any
  colour — it only forces the scheme: `:root[data-theme="light"]` sets
  `color-scheme: light` and `:root[data-theme="dark"]` sets `color-scheme: dark`,
  and every token follows. (`light-dark()` is Baseline since mid-2024 — Chrome
  123, Firefox 120, Safari 17.5.)
- Older browsers without `light-dark()` get a fallback that **duplicates** the
  palette: the plain `:root` block carries the light values, and an
  `@supports not (color: light-dark(...))` block carries the dark values
  (applied both by `prefers-color-scheme: dark` and by the forced
  `:root[data-theme="dark"]`). So when adding or renaming a colour, change the
  `light-dark()` token **and** its fallback copies. `test/themeFallback.test.js`
  binds every fallback value back to its `light-dark()` token, so a forgotten
  copy fails the build rather than drifting silently.
- The theme logic lives in two places. One small inline script in `<head>`
  applies a saved theme from `localStorage` before first paint to avoid a flash;
  it must stay inline (an external/deferred script would flash). `js/theme-toggle.js`
  (a `type="module"` script at the end of `<body>`) injects the toggle button as
  progressive enhancement — without JS, the OS preference still drives colours via
  CSS and no dead control is shown. "auto" clears the `data-theme` attribute and
  the `localStorage` key, handing control back to the OS. What counts as a valid
  override is `normalizeMode()` in `js/theme.js` (reused by the toggle); the inline
  guard duplicates that check by hand only because it must run before any module
  can load.

Keep these consistent: the `localStorage` key is `"theme"` with values
`"light"`/`"dark"` (absent = auto), and the override is the `data-theme`
attribute on `<html>`. The two `<meta name="theme-color">` values (one per
`prefers-color-scheme`) must equal the CSS `--page-bg` light/dark sides;
`test/themeColor.test.js` enforces that so the browser chrome can't drift from
the page background. `theme-toggle.js` also locates those two metas by hardcoding
their exact `content=` hex into its `querySelector` calls; `test/themeToggleMeta.test.js`
binds those selectors back to the metas so renaming the palette can't silently
break the toggle's chrome-tint sync (the guarded lookup would otherwise just skip
the update). `test/themeGuard.test.js` verifies the inline pre-paint
guard stays consistent with the module-based `normalizeMode()` by extracting and
evaluating the inline scripts (via `tools/inline-scripts.mjs`).

## JavaScript layout and the CSP

`index.html` carries exactly one inline script — the pre-paint theme guard above.
(A `<script type="application/ld+json">` block provides structured data for
search engines; it's data, not executable, and needs no CSP hash.) Everything
else is in `js/`, loaded with `type="module"`: `theme-toggle.js` (the toggle UI)
and `terminal.js` (the interactive guest-shell easter egg, unrelated
to theming). The card is dressed as a macOS Terminal session and the prompt accepts
commands: `ls` lists the directory (`projects/` and `whoami.sh`), which you then
run as in a real shell — `./whoami.sh` and `ls projects/` reprint the boot
blocks; `uptime`/`date`/`echo` behave like their shell namesakes, `sudo` returns
the classic lecture, `clear` empties the screen (hiding the boot output, like a
real terminal), and `help` lists the commands (the filesystem entries are
discovered via `ls`, not advertised). Everything else is denied with a fitting
shell error (privileged commands like `su`/`doas`/`chmod`/`chown` get "permission
denied", paths with `/` get "No such file or directory", anything else gets
"command not found"). The pure logic each depends on is factored out for
testing — `theme.js` (`nextTheme()`, `normalizeMode()`, `metaMediaFor()`),
`commands.js` (`reply()` for the command replies and denials, `help()` for the
listing, `formatUptime()` for the `uptime` output) and `terminal-ui.js`
(`capLimit()`, `recallHistory()`, `shouldGrabFocus()`, `shouldRefit()` — the
scrollback cap, history-recall arithmetic, focus-steal guard and the
width-change re-freeze guard lifted out of the event handlers) — and exercised
by `test/theme.test.js`, `test/commands.test.js`,
`test/terminalUi.test.js`, `test/themeColor.test.js`,
`test/themeFallback.test.js` and `test/themeGuard.test.js`.
The remaining DOM glue in the two UI modules is thin, but the wiring itself (a
click, keystroke or storage event mutating the DOM) is covered by jsdom tests
in `test/terminalDom.test.js` and `test/themeToggleDom.test.js`, which drive the
modules against a document built from the real `index.html` (see
`test/helpers/dom.js`). Layout- and paint-dependent behaviour — `fitScreen`'s
height freeze, the input growing with its content, click-to-focus and the theme
toggle actually repainting the page — has no layout or computed `color-scheme`
under jsdom, so it is covered by Playwright browser smoke tests in
`e2e/terminal.spec.js` (run via `npm run test:e2e`, served by python's
http.server per `playwright.config.js`).

`npm run coverage` runs the same `node --test` suite with
`--experimental-test-coverage` and fails if the unit-tested surface drops below
the pinned thresholds (lines 98%, branches 95%, functions 100%). This is the
test step `validate.sh` and CI run — plain `npm test` stays available for fast
local iteration without the gate. The two DOM-glue modules (`js/terminal.js`,
`js/theme-toggle.js`) are excluded from the coverage accounting because their
paint-dependent half is deliberately covered by Playwright, not `node --test`,
so counting them here would demand covering code a node-only run can't reach.
The pure-logic modules and the shared `tools/` helpers carry the gate instead.
Passing `--test-coverage-exclude` overrides Node's default test-file exclusion,
so `test/**` is re-excluded explicitly alongside the two modules.

The page sends a strict Content-Security-Policy **twice**: a `<meta http-equiv>`
tag in `index.html` and an HTTP header in `.htaccess`. Both are `default-src
'none'` with `script-src 'self'` (the `js/` modules) plus a single `'sha256-…'`
for the inline guard, `style-src 'self'`, `img-src 'self'`, and
`base-uri`/`form-action 'none'`. The `.htaccess` header is the production
superset — it adds `frame-ancestors 'none'` and `upgrade-insecure-requests`,
which a meta CSP can't express — while the meta stays as the baseline the python
dev server actually applies (so CSP is testable locally). Three consequences when
editing:

- **Edit the inline `<head>` script and its hash changes.** `tools/check-csp.mjs`
  recomputes the sha256 of every inline script and fails the build if it isn't in
  **both** policies, so CI catches a stale hash. It also verifies the two policies
  agree on every other directive — the header may add only `frame-ancestors` and
  `upgrade-insecure-requests`, the rest must match — so loosening or dropping a
  directive in just one file is caught too. Run `npm run check:csp`, copy the
  `expected token` it prints into the `script-src` list in **both `index.html` and
  `.htaccess`**, and re-run. New external scripts under `js/` need no hash (covered
  by `'self'`); a `<script>` of a non-JS type like `application/ld+json` is data,
  not executed, and needs none either. The inline-script extraction logic used by
  `check-csp.mjs` is shared in `tools/inline-scripts.mjs` (also used by
  `test/themeGuard.test.js`).
- The other security headers (`Strict-Transport-Security`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy`, the cross-origin isolation trio
  `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`/`Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`/`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`,
  and a `Header always unset Server`) and caching rules (long-cache for
  static images, no-cache for HTML/CSS/JS) also live in `.htaccess`. None of
  these apply under the python dev server; verify them after a deploy with
  `curl -sI https://acurioustale.de/`.
- `.htaccess` is in the deploy set and ships to the web root; the rsync jail's
  path prefix already covers it, so no server-side change is needed.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` auto-deploys via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which runs
`deploy.sh`. The script copies the deploy set (`index.html`, `.htaccess`,
`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `humans.txt`, `css/`, `js/` and `assets/`) into a
temporary staging directory, stamps the current Unix-millisecond time into
`LAST_DEPLOY` in the **staged** `js/commands.js` (so the terminal's `uptime`
counts from the live deploy), then mirrors the staging directory to the host with
`rsync -avz --delete`. The staging approach means the git working tree is never
modified — no dirty files, no restore-on-exit races. The `deploy` job therefore
sets up Node (for the stamping) in addition to SSH. CI authenticates with the
`DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` / `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS` repo secrets. The workflow sets
least-privilege token scopes at the top level (`permissions: contents: read`) —
neither the `validate` nor the `deploy` job writes to the repo (deploy
authenticates over SSH, not the `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so keep that block if you edit
the workflow.

The `TARGET` in `deploy.sh` **must keep its trailing slash** (`html/acurioustale.de/`).
The deploy key is jailed server-side to a forced `rsync` command that matches that
exact path prefix — no shell, no pull, no traversal. Changing the target breaks the
deploy. See the README for the full explanation.

Two deploy invariants: `deploy.sh` must stage the full deploy set (the
`DEPLOY_ASSETS` array — a file added to the site but not to that array never
ships), and because the jail only permits the one `rsync` push it is written
for, any new remote SSH command the deploy runs needs a matching allow-entry in
the forced command. That command lives on the host; a reviewed copy is checked
in at `ops/rsync-jail-acurioustale.sh` (server file authoritative, installed by
hand — see `ops/README.md`).

## Conventions

Commits follow Conventional Commits (`type(scope): imperative`, lowercase, ≤72-char header, no attribution trailers, hyphens not dashes). Scopes seen in history: `deploy`, `js`, `terminal`, `security`, `commands`, `tools`, `validate`, `links`, `deps`, `site`. Versioning is SemVer.

Formatting and linting are tool-enforced (Prettier, shfmt, stylelint, markdownlint, svgo, actionlint) — run `./validate.sh` before pushing to catch exactly what CI gates. Keep a large mechanical reformat in its own commit and list it in `.git-blame-ignore-revs` so `git blame` skips it.
