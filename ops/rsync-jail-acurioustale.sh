# rsync-jail-acurioustale.sh - forced command jailing the CI deploy key.
#
# Reviewed source, manually installed by an admin; the SERVER FILE IS
# AUTHORITATIVE. This copy is kept in version control for review and recovery
# only - it is not installed or run by CI or deploy.sh (though shellcheck and
# shfmt do lint it, to catch a shell bug before it is hand-copied to the host).
# On the host it lives at /home/www/web4186/bin/rsync-jail-acurioustale.sh,
# pinned to the deploy key in that account's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys via
# command="/home/www/web4186/bin/rsync-jail-acurioustale.sh",restrict. Keep this
# copy in sync when the host file changes; the host wins. See ops/README.md.
#
# Before installing a change here, verify it still accepts the exact command the
# host's rsync issues for the deploy (the server-side option bundle varies by
# rsync version): run one real ./deploy.sh --dry-run against the host.
#
# Forced command: confine this SSH key to pushing the deploy set into one
# directory via rsync. Four gates - push-only, no traversal, destination inside
# the web root, and an option allowlist - plus --munge-links so a smuggled
# symlink can't escape the jail when the site is served.
